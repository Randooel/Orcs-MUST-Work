      - Greet you I shall, fellow coworker!
      - We are about to throw a party to celebrate you joining our crew.
      - But... we are lacking coffee. Would you be so kind as to bring us some?
      - You're an ORC, after all. And as they say, "Orcs MUST work".
      - I'll be waiting for you here. :D
